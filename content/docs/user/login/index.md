In order to log in, you need an account with the same username as your GitHub account.

If you're the root administrator, we've already created your account.

Otherwise, please reach out to your root administrator to [create your account](/docs/admin/users/#administration).

Pressing the **Signup with GitHub** button will redirect you to GitHub, where you will be asked to authorize the application.

You need to **authorize** it. We only ask access to your profile.

The GitHub authorization page is opened in a new tab. If no tab opened, make sure that your browser didn't block it.
