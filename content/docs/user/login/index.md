In order to log in to FrontLine, you need to have a Github account linked to FrontLine.

Ask the administrator to [create one](/docs/admin/users/#administration).
(*if you're the first user, the Gatling support team has already created yours.*)

Pressing the **Signup with Github** button will redirect you to Github, where you will be asked to authorize the application.

You need to **authorize** it. We only ask access to your profile informations.

The Github authorization page is opened in a new tab. If no tab opened, make sure that your browser didn't block it.
