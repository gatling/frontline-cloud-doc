// FIXME: filled with new login method

== Accessing your profile

You can view your profile at any time by clicking on the *My Profile* button in the navigation bar.

// FIXME: GitHub Oauth changes (no password change)
{{< img src="profile.png" alt="Profile" >}}

The informations displayed are the following:

- Username
- First and Last name
- Mail address
- Different roles

To update your profile, modify the fields you want to change, then click on the button *Update your informations*.

You can't update your username here. You need to ask a System Admin to change your roles on the *Users Admin* page.
