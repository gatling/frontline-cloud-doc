## Managing

To access the Packages section, click on **Packages** in the navigation bar.

The Packages view contains all the packages you have configured with the given name, team, and filename of uploaded package if not empty.

The Gatling version of the package is displayed in a badge next to the filename.

- **Name**: the name that will appear on the simulations build step.
- **Team**:
  - you can select **Global** so that all teams have access to the package;
  - or select **Specific** and choose a single team which will own the package.

## Upload

### Option 1: Manual Upload

In order to fill the package with your bundled simulation, click on the {{< icon upload >}} icon on the right side of the table.

{{< alert tip >}}
In order to package a bundle of your simulation, refer to the [Package Generation documentation]({{< ref "../package_gen" >}}).
{{< / alert >}}

You can upload multiple packages concurrently. Uploads progress will be shown in the Packages table.

You can cancel an upload in progress by clicking on the cancel icon.

### Option 2: API Upload

You can also upload packages programmatically with our REST API.

You'll need:
* an [API token]({{< ref "../../admin/api_tokens" >}}) with at least the `Packages` permission
* the Package's ID, which can be copied from the WebUI.

You can then upload your package, eg with `curl`:

```
curl -X PUT --upload-file <PACKAGE_LOCAL_PATH> \
  "https://<DOMAIN>/api/public/artifacts/<PACKAGE_ID>/content?filename=<PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>" \
  -H "Authorization:<API_TOKEN>"
```

## Usage

You can configure which package to use for a simulation in the simulation's **Build** step.
