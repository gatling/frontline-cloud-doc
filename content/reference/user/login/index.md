To log in, you need a GitHub account.

If you want to connect with an existing organization, please reach out to a System Admin to [join an organization]({{< ref "../../admin/users#managing-users" >}}).

Pressing the **Continue with GitHub** button will redirect you to GitHub, where you will be asked to authorize the application.

You need to **authorize** it. We only ask access to your public profile and email address.

The GitHub authorization page opens in a new tab. If no tab opens, make sure that your browser doesn't block it.

If a System Admin added you to their organization, you're logged in.

Otherwise, you need to Signup.
