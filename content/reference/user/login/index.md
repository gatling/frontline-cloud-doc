Pressing the **Continue with GitHub** button will redirect you to GitHub, where you will be asked to authorize the application.

You will need to **authorize** it. We only require access to your public profile and email address.

{{< alert danger >}}
The GitHub authorization page opens in a new tab. If no tab opens, make sure that your browser doesn't block it.

If a System Admin has invited you to their organization, you should now be able to accept the invitation you received by email.

Otherwise, you will be redirected to the **Organization creation** page.
