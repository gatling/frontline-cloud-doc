## Accessing your profile

{{< img src="profile-menu.png" alt="My profile button" >}}

You can view your profile at any time by clicking on the **My profile** button, from the drop-down menu available by clicking
on the organization button at the top-right of the screen.

{{< img src="profile.png" alt="Profile view" >}}

The following information is shown:

- First and Last name
- Email address
- Your roles (for all teams and for specific teams)

To update your profile, modify the fields you want to change, then click on the button **Update your information**.

You cannot change your roles here. You need to ask a System Admin [to change them]{{< ref "../../admin/users#managing-users" >}}.
You can [see the list of your System Admins]({{< ref "../organization#admin-users" >}}) on the **Organization** page, accessible
from the drop-down menu at the top-right of the screen.
