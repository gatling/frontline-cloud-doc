Dedicated IP Addresses allow you to have control over the load generators' IP addresses.
This is useful, for example, if your target system performs some sort of IP address filtering.

The Dedicated IP addresses table shows your available dedicated IP addresses. Each one belongs to a specific location.

## Usage

You can enable the use of dedicated IP addresses when [configuring simulation locations]({{< ref "../simulations#step-2-locations-configuration" >}}).

When starting a run of a simulation configured to use dedicated IP addresses,
if you have enough dedicated IP addresses available to satisfy the size of the configured locations,
they will be reserved for the run duration.  If you donâ€™t have enough dedicated IP addresses available, the run won't start.
