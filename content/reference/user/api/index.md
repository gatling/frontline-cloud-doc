The Gatling Enterprise API server also exposes a public API that you can use to trigger runs or fetch run results and metrics.

We also use this API for our Continuous Integration plugins and our Grafana datasource.

This API is protected with [API tokens]({{< ref "../../admin/api_tokens" >}}), which can be generated by your organization's System Admins through the `API Tokens` page.

You can access the Swagger documentation using the `Swagger API` button on the Documentation modal accessible on the navigation bar (bottom left of the screen).

IDs can be retrieved on table either under kebab menu, or on the right of the table:
{{< img src="kebab-copy.png" alt="Simulation copy ID" >}}
{{< img src="right-copy.png" alt="Run copy ID" >}}

Some information before using the public API:

- The `Authorization` header is mandatory. Its value must be `bearer ` concatenated with the value of your ApiToken. Beware of the white space after the bearer prefix.
- ApiToken must be present in the `Authorization` header after the `bearer ` prefix (exactly `bearer ` with one space)
- You have to provide the run ID as a query parameter to fetch other run metadata (load generators, remotes, hostnames, scenarios, groups, requests)
- The `from` and `to` query parameters for the `/series` endpoint are the lower and upper timestamp bounds of the time window you want to query. You can fetch the total run time window from the `/runs` endpoint (`injectStart`, `injectEnd`).
- The returned percentiles by the API are: min, p25, p50, p75, p80, p85, p90, p95, p99, p999, p9999 and max.
