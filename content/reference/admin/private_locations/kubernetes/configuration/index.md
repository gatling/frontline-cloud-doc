## Instance Specifications

We recommend that you use for your own load generators pods with at least 4 cores. See CPU requests and limits configuration below.

You might want to tune the `Xmx` JVM options to half of the memory request.
See `jvm-options` configuration below.
If you don't, the JVM will use a max heap size of 1/4th of the physical memory.

Also, if you're deploying your load generators in the same cluster as the application under test,
we recommend that you isolate the load generators on their dedicated nodes, using taints and tolerations.
See `tolerations` configuration below.

## Permissions

To use Kubernetes private locations, the control plane must have access to your Kubernetes cluster.

If the control plane is launched from outside the cluster, you have to give access to a valid Kubernetes file. See [Organizing Cluster Access Using kubeconfig Files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
The `.kube` folder can be mounted in `/app`, and absolute path must be set in a `KUBECONFIG` environment variable (e.g. `KUBECONFIG=/app/.kube/config`)

If the control plane is launched from inside the cluster, please refer to our [Kubernetes Control plane deployment documentation]({{< ref "../installation" >}})

{{< alert tip >}}
When connecting to the cluster using HTTPS, if a custom truststore and/or keystore is needed, `KUBERNETES_TRUSTSTORE_FILE`,
 `KUBERNETES_TRUSTSTORE_PASSPHRASE` and/or `KUBERNETES_KEYSTORE_FILE`, `KUBERNETES_KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE` environment variables should be set.

## System requirements

Kubernetes private locations image rely on some dependencies.

So when using a custom image, make sure following are available:

- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
- [Java runtime environment](https://openjdk.org/install/): OpenJDK 64bits LTS versions: 11, 17 or 21 (see [Gatling prerequisites](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/tutorials/installation/#java-version))

{{< alert tip >}}
Learn how to tune the OS for more performance, configure the open files limit, the kernel and the network [here](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/core/operations/).
