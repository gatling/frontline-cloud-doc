## GCP Virtual Machines
GCP private locations require the control plane to have GCP access rights configured in order to instantiate virtual machines.

### Service account
Access rights can be set through a service account associated with your control plane.

Check GCP and Gatling documentation pages for more details:
* [GCP Service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)
* [Gatling installation guide]({{< ref "../../installation/gcp/#service-account" >}})

### Control plane configuration file

```bash
control-plane {
  # Control plane token
  token = "cpt_example_c7oze5djp3u14a5xqjanh..."
  # Control plane token with an environment variable
  token = ${?CONTROL_PLANE_TOKEN}
  # Control plane token with a system property
  token = $?control.plane.token
  # Control plane description (optional)
  description = "my control plane description"
  # Locations configurations
  locations = [
    {
      # Private location ID, must be prefixed by prl_, only consist of numbers 0-9, 
      # lowercase letters a-z, and underscores, with a max length of 30 characters
      id = "prl_private_location_example"

      # JVM Options (optional)

## Internet access for your Load Generators instances

Cloud NAT (Network Address Translation) lets certain resources in Google Cloud create outbound connections to the internet or to other Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks. 
Cloud NAT supports address translation for established inbound response packets only. **It does not allow unsolicited inbound connections.**

More info on [Cloud NAT overview](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview).

### Instances with no external IP

An instance without an external IP cannot access to internet without a Cloud NAT configured on the network, for the region.
Load generators must have access to some outbound domains in order to run (see [Private locations introduction]({{< ref "../../introduction" >}})).

In the GCP management console, open the [Cloud NAT](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/nat) (or search for "Cloud NAT" in the search bar).

Set the Gateway:
- name
- region base on your location zone
- create a router

{{< img src="cloud-nat-router.png" alt="Router configuration" >}}

###  Set static IPs

Cloud NAT gateway can be configured with static IP addresses.
See limits of concurrent connections with Cloud NAT on [Cloud NAT port reservation](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/ports-and-addresses#examples) and 
make sure to provide enough static IP addresses based on the load you need to generate.
