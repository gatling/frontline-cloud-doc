## Kubernetes
To use Kubernetes private locations, the control plane must have access to your Kubernetes cluster.

If the control plane is launched from outside the cluster, you have to give access to a valid Kubernetes file. See [Organizing Cluster Access Using kubeconfig Files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).
The `.kube` folder can be mounted in `/app`, and absolute path must be set in a `KUBECONFIG` environment variable (e.g. `KUBECONFIG=/app/.kube/config`)

If the control plane is launched from inside the cluster, please refer to our [Kubernetes Control plane deployment documentation]({{< ref "../../installation/kubernetes" >}})

{{< alert tip >}}
When connecting to the cluster using HTTPS, if a custom truststore and/or keystore is needed, `KUBERNETES_TRUSTSTORE_FILE`,
 `KUBERNETES_TRUSTSTORE_PASSPHRASE` and/or `KUBERNETES_KEYSTORE_FILE`, `KUBERNETES_KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE` environment variables should be set.

### Control plane configuration file

```bash
control-plane {
  # Control plane token
  token = "cpt_example_c7oze5djp3u14a5xqjanh..."
  # Control plane token with an environment variable
  token = ${?CONTROL_PLANE_TOKEN}

  description = "my control plane description"
  # Locations configurations
  locations = [
    {

### Custom image requirements

Kubernetes private locations image rely on some dependencies.

So when using a custom image, make sure following are available:

- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
- [Java runtime environment](https://openjdk.org/install/): OpenJDK 64bits LTS versions: 11, 17 or 21 (see [Gatling prerequisites](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/tutorials/installation/#java-version))
