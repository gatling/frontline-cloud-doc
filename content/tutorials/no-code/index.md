## Inroduction
The Gatling no-code generator is the fastest way to discover load testing and how it can improve your application, microservice, or API. The no-code generator is a graphical user interface that lets you:
- [setup your scenario](#setup-your-scenario),
- [setup the virtual user injection profile](#setup-the-injection-profile),
- (optional) [define acceptance criteria](#define-acceptance-criteria-optional),
- [select a testing location](#select-the-testing-location).

Once you start your simulation, the load testing data are displayed in real-time. The following guide assists you in writing and launching your first load test. To keep learning about Gatling and load testing, see these helpful resources:
- [Gatling Community](https://community.gatling.io)
- [Gatling Academy](https://gatling.io/academy/)

## Access Gatling Enterprise Cloud
To access the Gatling no-code generator:
1. Navigate to https://cloud.gatling.io in your web browser.
2. Login or register if you don't have an account. 
3. Click on **Create a simulation without coding** in the _Latest simulation runs_ pane on the landing page. 

The no-code generator is divided into 4 steps with a dynamically updated code example in Java, Scala, and Kotlin. The code example shows you how the resulting simulation can be written in your preferred programming language.

## Setup your scenario
Setting up a scenario requires defining the user request(s) and any pauses between the user request(s). For this tutorial, we use the Gatling sample website https://computer-database.gatling.io to demonstrate load testing with the no-code generator. To set up the scenario, click **Test sample website** under the _Your website URL_ heading.

## Setup the injection profile
The second step in creating a no-code simulation is setting up the injection profile. This is where you have the most options for describing the test. There are 3 broad categories of tests:
- **Capacity tests** tell you how your application performs as resource demand increases.
- **Stress tests** tell you how your application performs when there is a rapid and transient increase in resource demand.
- **Soak tests** tell you how your application performs with a regular load over a long period of time (e.g., test for memory leaks). 

{{< img src="setup-injection.png" alt="An example of the injection profile set up" >}}

Following the test type, inputs describe the test duration and the user injection profile. For this tutorial:
1. Select _Capacity test_.
2. Enter 90 seconds for the total test duration.
3. Enter 1 for the initial user arrival rate.
4. Enter 10 for the final user arrival rate. 

## Define acceptance criteria (optional) 
Acceptance criteria, also called Assertions, allow you to establish whether or not a simulation result meets your requirements. For example, if you expect 95% or more of your users to experience a response time of 0.25 seconds or faster, you would set the 95th percentile response time to 0.25. 

{{< img src="assertions.png" alt="An example of the assertions option" >}}

To activate acceptance criteria:
1. Click **Global 95th percentile on response time should be lower than** toggle button to enable the criterion.
2. Enter the value 0.25 in the input field.
3. Click **Global success ratio to be higher than** toggle button to enable the criterion.
4. Enter the value 99%.

## Select the testing location
The final step for defining your no-code simulation is to select the traffic origin location. 

{{< img src="almost-done.png" alt="An example of the test location and naming step" >}}

Under the _Location_ heading, click the arrow to open the dropdown menu and select a location from the list. The Gatling test web application is hosted near Paris, so this location usually gives the best performance.  

Finally, name your simulation and select a team (usually _default_).   

## Launch the test
Click the **Save and launch** button to launch your no-code simulation. 

Congratulations, you have finished your first load test with Gatling Enterprise Cloud. The results are displayed in real-time. At the end of the simulation, you can explore the results. Make sure to visit the _Report_ tab to see the detailed results, including:
- response time percentiles,
- connections,
- DNS resolutions.

To keep exploring the no-code generator, click the **Edit simulation** button and change your simulation. For example, try changing the load generator location to _AP SouthEast - Sydney_ to see how users further away from the Gatling test web application experience different response times. Happy testing!
